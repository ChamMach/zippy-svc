# [WIP] Zippy HTTP Service

A zip service to create archives from remote files.

## TODO

[ ] Add security (JWT with shared public key)
[ ] Move archives to another storage (S3, FTP, any flysystem adapter)
[ ] Add more download adapters (FTP, S3, ...)
[ ] Support compression options

## Security

Security is not implement yet. You should consider using this service on a very private network, as an internal service.
